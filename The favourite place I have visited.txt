The recent favourite place I have visited along with friends is Goa.It was a memorable experience visiting ancient chrurches and colorful beaches in and around Goa.Paragliding and Water thriller rides which I went during this adventurous trip was close to my heart. Also,One night, we went for a beautiful restaurant near Baga Beach at night for dinner. It was a restaurant with an ope air theatre, we enjoyed the dinner along with some charming and eyeful dance happening infront of us.
